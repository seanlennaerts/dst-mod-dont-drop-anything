# Don't Drop Anything

![modicon](images/modicon.png)

A server side mod for Don't Starve Together.

## Description

Actually don't drop anything when you die.

The current most popular Don't Drop Everything mod is great but still forces at least one drop. If you really don't want to drop anything, even your equipped item, then this is the mod for you!

Please note this means that it won't even drop the telltale heart!
